An introductory set of visualizations and tables that give insight into the different raw number and proportions of species classified as some level of threatened by the US National Park service. One of the main focuses of the assignment was the data cleaning process, which included the joining of a few separate datasets, creating new categorical variables for the numerous national park regions, and the removal of any missing data.\n\n\nThis presentation was created by Katelyn McClure, Megan Diller, and Sydney Stratton.\n\n\nCheck out our report and presentation!"

    "text": "Admixture mapping is important for identifying disease genes, especially in populations with mixed ancestry. In the summer of 2024, we worked on improving an R package, called STEAM, that finds a genome-wide significance threshold that can be used in admixture mapping. Our process started with reviewing how other researchers were utilizing STEAM in their own research projects, and then using this understanding to improve and debug the code. We also prioritized enhancing the usability of the STEAM package with new features and updated documentation in addition to making efforts to increase STEAM’s visibility as an R package. My primary focus was creating a vignette to serve as a guide for new users of the package.\n\n\nThis project was led by Dr. Kelsey Grinde with undergraduate research assistants Katelyn McClure, Sydney Ohr, and Tina Chen.\n\n\nCheck out our research poster and the STEAM R package!"

:::{#intro-heading}

I am a student at Macalester College studying Statistics and Mathematics. I am passionate about equity as it relates to data collection and analysis, especially in the world of sports analytics. I love statistics because it can be relevant to a wide variety of other fields, and I am excited to see where my studies take me in the professional world.

## Education

Macalester College | St. Paul MN <br>
B.A. in Statistics | Sept 2022 - May 2026

## About Me

Outside of my studies, I enjoy Minnesota winters (like a true life-long Minnesotan!), spending time with my two cats, watching *Impractical Jokers*, and attending concerts in the Twin Cities area.
